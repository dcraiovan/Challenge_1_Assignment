# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter. 
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 

### Purpose
This is an Excel Analysis of four thousand past Kickstarter projects' level of success in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
No challenges were encountered. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. 

  January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  In the subcategory plays no campaigns were cancelled, all either succeeded or failed. Campaigns with goals less than $1000 have the highest success rate, while campaigns with goals between $25000 and $29999 have the highest rate of failure (excluding the 45000 to 49999 range as it only had one campaign and it failed).

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  The dataset is not large enough for all categories and subcategories, therefore some of the results are not statistically relevant given the small sample size. We need to figure out how statistically significant these results are.
   We need to analyze a variety of crowdsourcing companies to draw more significant insights.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

   It would be interesting to analyze the projects by the duration of conversion using the date created conversion and date ended conversion in order to see what separates the duration of successful and unsuccessful projects.
  Analyzing the data by states, if possible, we could see trends in which states have Kickstarters with the highest and lowest rates of success.
  We need more information on the “successful” state in order to evaluate if they became profitable in the long run and established companies.
